<!-- </footer> /.post-info -->                <p>The 6th of our workshops took place on 26th of may 2022 as an online conference.
The central topic of the workshop were the non-reductive conceptions of
naturalism within the framework of philosophical pragmatism. The first speaker
was a foreign guest dr. Paul Giladi from Metropolitan University in Manchester.
Then a member of our research team Emil Višňovský from the Department of
Philosophy and History of Philosophy at Comenius University in Bratislava gave
his presentation. Finally, Róbert Maco from the same institution and also our
team member, critically responded to previous contributions. </p>
<p><img src="/en/images/sixth_workshop_1.jpg" style="width:760px"></p>
<p>At the beginning of the workshop, prof. Emil Višňovský introduced dr. Paul
Galadi by way of general summary of his philosophical interests and via the
selection of author's publications which were directly related to the workshop's
theme. </p>
<p>Dr. Giladi gave his presentation <em>Pragmatist Conception of Naturalism</em>
thereafter. As the title suggest, the aim of this talk was to review various
conceptions of philosophical naturalism from the point of view of pragmatist
tradition - starting with its classical era (Ch. S. Pierce, W. James, J. Dewey)
up to contemporary period of so called "New Pragmatism". Giladi used this
foundation to point out that pragmatists - from W. James to H. Price - were
exponents, or at least were partial to, so called "non-reductive" or "liberal"
naturalism. This kind of naturalists are critical towards so called "reductive"
or "scientific" naturalism which conceives the scientific image of the world as
<em>the</em> correct one. Throughout the presentation, Giladi has highlighted several
times that most of contemporary pragmatists strive to see the world not only
from the scientific, but also from the normative, culturally-theoretical
perspective, in virtue of, for example, being engaged in investigations of the political and
ethical implications of naturalism. Giladi concluded by suggesting that
naturalist component of pragmatist philosophy up till 1940s can be taken as a
good starting point for a new critical reflection of naturalism from the
normative and culturally-theoretical perspective.</p>
<p><img src="/en/images/sixth_workshop_2.jpg" style="width:760px"></p>
<p>Prof. Emil Višňovský expanded upon Giladi's presentation with a talk titled
"Non-reductive Conceptions of Naturalism", in which he explored in more detail
the main characterstics of non-reductive naturalism of pragmatist
philosophy. According to Višňovský, an essential feature of non-reductive
naturalism is to resolve traditional philosophical antinomies between nature
and culture, mental and physical, subjective and objective, etc. In view of
this, Višňovský pointed out that it is important to understand non-reductive
naturalism as "global", covering all phenomena and domains, including the
philosophy of nature, of culture, of mind, ethics, and so on. This directly
contradicts the scope and ambitions of reductive naturalism which aims to reduce
all phenomena and domains to the ontology of natural sciences. In opposition,
Višňovský claimed that the ontology of all these domains is not reducable to
some one domain, that is, the ontology is supposed to be pluralistic. For
example, someone can be a naturalist in ethics, whitout reducing moral or
normative concepts to concepts of natural sciences. This assumption made
Višňovský to propose to supplant the concept of "non-reductive naturalism" with
the concept of "pluralistic naturalism".</p>
<p>In the final presentation titled as <em>Critical Notes on Pragmatist and
Non-reductionist Conceptions of Naturalism</em>, dr. Róbert Maco has proposed some
evaluations of preceding contributions. He focused himself on the relationship
between non-reductive nad other forms of naturalism - specifically on reductive
naturalism and supernaturalism. According to Maco, a problematic feature of
naturalism is its "excessive openness" or "liberalism" - althought non-reductive
naturalists deny supranatural phenomena (e.g., cartesian souls), they are also
trying to preserve the autonomy of mental phenomena (such as consciousness or
intentionality) or normative phenomena (e.g., rules, institutions), which
reductive naturalists strive to explain solely on the basis of phenomena of natural sciences.
This can lead one to suppose that almost any philosopher can be supposed to be a
"naturalist", including ones which hold properly non-naturalist or
supernaturalist positions. The ensuing discussion has showed, on the other hand, that
the openness of non-reductive variants of naturalism has also some benefits,
since we currently lack any naturalist explanation of some mental or normative
pehenomena, the importance of which is stressed by non-reductive naturalists.</p>
<p><img src="/en/images/sixth_workshop_3.jpg" style="width:760px"></p>
<p>Lively and inspiring discussion at the end of the workshop has shown that
non-reductive naturalism appears to be an attractive position in contemporary
philosophy. But defining features of non-reductive naturalism remain unclear,
which is an impetus towards further philosophical investigations.</p>

                <p>We are happy to announce that our first workshop will take place in november. It will be dedicated to the subject of human nature as understood through the lens of aristotelian and neoaristotelian philosophy. Three speakers will present their ideas at the workshop: NAUFIP's principal investigator professor Michal Chabada, doc. Petr Dvořák from Czech Academy of Sciences, and doc. Marián Kuna from Catholic University in Ružomberok.</p>
