      <p>Our fourth workshop took place on the 3. 12. 2021. The topics dealt in the
workshop were related to the philosophy of mind and consciousness. The online
meeting was opened and moderated by prof. Emil Višňovský, who has introduced the
subject matter traditionally influenced by cartesian dualism and also one of the
sources of anti-naturalism. Nevertheless, some new contemporary theories, such
as "Neuro-pragmatism", make significant contributions towards "naturalisation"
of mind and consciousness. One such theory is "ilusionism", which was introduced
at the workshop by Mgr. KAtarína Sklutová from the Department of Philosophy and
History of Philosophy.</p>
<p><img src="/en/images/fourth_workshop_1.png" style="width:760px"></p>
<p>Illusionism, as one of the theoretical position in contemporary philosophy of
consciousness, was formulated by Keith Frankish in his paper <em>Illusionism as a
Theory of Consciousness</em> (2016). But the position is not entirely new and we can
find, for example, Daniel Dennett among its longstanding defenders. The
ilusionists assume that the „phenomenal character“ (phenomenal properties,
qualia) of conscious experience is an illusion produced as an artifact of limits
of introspection. The illusionism then substitutes the „hard problem of
consciousness“ with „problem of illusion“, that is, with the problem of why it
seems that experiences have phenomenal properties. Given that illusionism
rejects the phenomenal character of consciousness, most o philosophers of mind
take the position to be radical and eliminative. But their criticism
is mostly a consequence of the assumption that the phenomenal character is a
fundamental explanandum of consciousness - a being is conscious insofar as it
is sensible to ask what it is like for them to be from their own subjective
perspective. While the illusionists do reject this conception of consciousness,
they do not reject it per se. The opposite is actually the case, since
illusionism is naturalistic position regarding consciousness to be a natural
phenomenon explainable on the basis of ongoing investigations in cognitive
sciences and neuroscience. From the point of view of our naturalist theory, we
should then reject those properties (e.g., 
phenomenal character, qualia) of consciousness that are in conflict with (or, at
least, dispensable for) empirical research. To quote the illusionists:
consciousness may not be what it seems.</p>
<p><img src="/en/images/fourth_workshop_5.png" style="width:760px"></p>
<p>Both contributions elicited lively discussion and polemics, centering around the
questions of human subjectivity, introspection and the so called problem of
qualia. The workshop provided us with new impulses for future work within the
project and justifed its connection to main currents in contemporary
international philosophy in the area.</p>
