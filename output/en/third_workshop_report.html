      <p>Our third workshop took place on the 8. 12. 2020, this time in the form of
online conference. The topic of the workshop was a confrontation of naturalistic
and constructivist approaches to the investigation of human nature specifically
in relation to sex and gender. One foreign guest Doc. Petr Dvořák, PhD., from
Sts Cyril and Methodius Faculty of Theology at Palacký University has given a
presentation. Our own team was represented by Doc. PhDr. Mariana Szapuová, PhD.,
from the Department of Philosophy and History of Philosophy at Comenius
University and the Center of Gender Studies.</p>
<p><img src="/en/images/workshop_III_01.jpg" style="width:760px"></p>
<p>The presentation of Doc. Szapuová was concerned with the use of the concept of
„gender“ in feminist philophy. She identified the historical origins of the
distinction between „sex“ and „gender“ in the work of cultural anthropologist
Margaret Mead <em>Sex and Temperament in Three Primitive Societies</em> (1935), the
work of professor of psychiatry and psychoanalyst Robert Stoller <em>Sex and
Gender: On Development of Masculinity and Feminity</em> (1968), and also in the
famous quote from Simon de Beauvoir “One is not born, but rather becomes, a
woman.”. She also pointed out that the concept of "gender" is multilayered and
introduced its three aspects in the conception of Sandra Harding - gender
symbolism, gendered structure of society and individual gender. To illustrate
the use of gender as an analytical category she mentioned feminist epistemology
and feminist investigation of the history of philosophy. On the background of 
social constructivism in sociology (P. Berger, T. Luckman: <em>The Social
Construction of Reality</em> (1966/1999)), she clarified the conception of gender as
a form of social construction. At the end of her presentation, Doc. Szapuová
introduced some critiques of the concept of gender from the standpoint of
feminist philosophy.</p>
<p><img src="/en/images/workshop_III_02.jpg" style="width:760px"></p>
<p>The aim of Doc. Dvořák presentation was to criticize the constructivist
approaches to gender. He distinguished two conceptions of gender - gender as a
role in a society and gender as an indentity (i.e., the way in which one
experiences ones gender identity), and pointed out that the former
understanding was more prevalent in the past, while the latter seems to be
more prominent nowdays. With concrete examples, he illustrated some
argumentative fallacies present in feminist discourse. Namely, the <em>ad hominem</em>
fallacy and the <em>inference from the conclusion</em> forms of argumentation, in which
a suitable theory is sought after in order to justify some already accepted
positions. This suppposedly also shows that there are social pressures
influencing discussions about the biological foundations of gender. Then he
introduced results of scientific studies supporting his thesis about the
bilogical basis of gender. In the conclusion of his presentation, Doc. Dvořák
argued against the claims of feminist philosopher Judith Butler (<em>Bodies That
Matter</em> (1993)), especially against her conception of gender as a result of
performative speech acts.</p>
<p>Presentations stimulated lively discussions, in part due to stark differences
between the positions of the speakers. Most of the questions were related to
biological foundations of gender roles, clarification of central concepts and
theoretical positions. In addition, some problems related to methodology of
scietific research were also touched upon, and several participants emphasized
the difference between correlation of two attributes and proof that they are
causaly related.</p>
