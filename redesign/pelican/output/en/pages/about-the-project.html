    <p class="lead">
<b>The starting point</b> of our research is the observation that naturalism, inspired
by the successes of natural sciences, seems to completely redefine competences
and weaken the autonomy of philosophy, humanitites and social sciences. In
addition, we consider also the weaker variants of naturalistic position which
allow for more reciprocal cooperation between natural sciences and other domains
of human knowledge. 
</p>

<p class="lead">
<b>The main aim</b> of our research is a complex, ciritcal and metaphilosophical
analysis of the nature and foundations of naturalism, the analysis of its
relationship with philosophy in general, and its influence on particular
philosophical subdisciplines. We also aim to evaluate the consequences which the
acceptance of basic tenets of naturalism has on our conception of philosophy and
on the ways we deal with its various subjects. The results of our research
should illuminate the overall dynamic of the relationship between philosophy and
special sciences brough about by the application of naturalistic approach
towards and within philosophy. 
</p>

<p class="lead">
<b>Thematically</b>, the research is oriented towards a general demarcation of
essential features of naturalism, development of precise and systematic
distinctions between its various types, and identification and evaluation of
benefits and limits of attempts to naturalize various philosophical issues. An
essential part of our research is also to take into account the relevant results
of special sciences, as well as proposing, on the basis of historical sources of
naturalism and its most promintent critiques, new perspective on given
philosophical approach from the point of view of history of philosophy. 
</p>

<p class="lead">
Our research is based on <b>assumptions</b>, according to which a) naturalism is not a
monolithic system of thought, but is rather diversified according to different
topics and degrees, b) from the metaphilosophical point of view, naturalism is
able to provide only a restricted account of the nature of philosophy, and c)
the success of naturalization is specifically limited in relation to various
philosophical subdisciplines (e.g., epistemology, philosophy of mind, ethics,
social philosophy and the philosophy of mathematics).
</p>

<p class="lead">
These assumptions lead us to formulate our <b>basic hypothesis</b> as follows:
</p>

<blockquote class="lead container" style="width:90%;">
<em>
There is no generally accepted form of naturalism. The benefits and limits of
attempts to naturalize defined topics (the nature of philosophy, mind, human
nature, epistemic and moral norms, logico-mathematical objects) are specifically
differentiated within individual subject areas. 
</em>
</blockquote>

<h2>Partial Aims of Research Proposal</h2>
<p>The proposal outlined above can be broken down into several partial goals
prompted by various questions which arise from contemporary theorizing of naturalism:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Systematic examination of the nature of naturalism and
   classification of its various forms.</em></p>
<p>"Naturalism" does not refer to one monolithic doctrine, but rather to
   a plurality of theories and strategies. This calls for devising a
   typology of different meanings and uses of the term.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Development of a conceptual appartus capable to capture the ways
   in which naturalistic approach redefines the nature of philosophy.</em> </p>
<p>From the metaphilosophical point of view, naturalism challenges us
   to rethink the nature and relevancy of philosophy and
   humanities. Taking the natural sciences and their methodology as an
   ideal the philosophy should strive for, threatens the traditional
   role occupied by the discipline or, worse, makes it obsolete.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Cost-benefit analysis of naturalistic approach within the context
   of specific philosophical subdisciplines.</em></p>
<p>Naturalism in <strong>metaethics</strong> is the position that all moral facts
   are natural ones. This upsets the traditional dichotomy between
   facts and values and may lead us to rethink the concept of human
   nature as something that grounds the moral norms.</p>
<p>Inspired by impulses from biology, linguistics, AI and cognitive
   sciences, naturalistically oriented strands in the <strong>philosophy of
   mind</strong> make attempts at reinterpretation of phenomena such as
   consciousness, self-consciousness or intentionality.</p>
<p>Naturalistic approaches are also wide-spread in <strong>epistemology</strong>,
   where they push forward a research programme leaning heavily on
   empirical research of cognitive processes, at times even
   supplanting completely the traditional epistemology with such
   research.</p>
<p>In the context of <strong>social philosophy</strong>, naturalistic point of view
   opens up the relationship between the biology and the social life
   of humans, making it impossible to theorize them separately.</p>
<p>We also aim to answer the question whether it is possible
   to give a naturalisitc account of <strong>logico-mathematical</strong> knowledge
   and, more generally, to naturalize abstract objects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Interpretation of findings of empirical sciences which
   inspired the attempts to naturalize traditional philosophical
   topics.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Grounding the classification of contemporary strands of naturalism
   in the analysis of its historical sources and critiques.</em></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Research schedule</h2>
<p>All the tasks involved in our research are spread throughout three
stages:</p>
<p><strong>July 1, 2019 - October 31, 2020:</strong> In the first, preparatory, phase,
we aim to explain the nature of naturalism, of the
naturalization of philosophy and of its specific areas. The findings
established in this stage will be presented at a project conference
which will take place in the middle of project's timeline.</p>
<p><strong>November 1, 2020 - October 30, 2022:</strong> In the central phase of our
research, we will deliver multidimensional and complex investigation
of its main subject, as well as of specific forms it assumes in
defined areas.</p>
<p><strong>November 1, 2022 - June 30, 2023:</strong> Finally, we aim to evaluate and
systematize partial findings established in previous phases. This will
mainly involve organizing the concluding project conference and
preparing publications which synthesize results of our research.</p>
