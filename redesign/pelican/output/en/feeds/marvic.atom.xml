online conference. The topic of the workshop was a confrontation of naturalistic
and constructivist approaches to the investigation of human nature specifically
in relation to sex and gender. One foreign guest Doc. Petr Dvořák, PhD., from
Sts Cyril and Methodius Faculty of Theology at Palacký University has given a
presentation. Our own team was represented by Doc. PhDr. Mariana Szapuová, PhD.,
from the Department of Philosophy and History of Philosophy at Comenius
University and the Center of Gender Studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/en/images/workshop_III_01.jpg" style="width:760px"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presentation of Doc. Szapuová was concerned with the use of the concept of
„gender“ in feminist philophy. She identified the historical origins of the
distinction between „sex“ and „gender“ in the work of cultural anthropologist
Margaret Mead &lt;em&gt;Sex and Temperament in Three Primitive Societies&lt;/em&gt; (1935), the
work of professor of psychiatry and psychoanalyst Robert Stoller &lt;em&gt;Sex and
Gender: On Development of Masculinity and Feminity&lt;/em&gt; (1968), and also in the
famous quote from Simon de Beauvoir “One is not born, but rather becomes, a
woman.”. She also pointed out that the concept of "gender" is multilayered and
introduced its three aspects in the conception of Sandra Harding - gender
symbolism, gendered structure of society and individual gender. To illustrate
the use of gender as an analytical category she mentioned feminist epistemology
and feminist investigation of the history of philosophy. On the background of 
social constructivism in sociology (P. Berger, T. Luckman: &lt;em&gt;The Social
Construction of Reality&lt;/em&gt; (1966/1999)), she clarified the conception of gender as
a form of social construction. At the end of her presentation, Doc. Szapuová
introduced some critiques of the concept of gender from the standpoint of
feminist philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/en/images/workshop_III_02.jpg" style="width:760px"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of Doc. Dvořák presentation was to criticize the constructivist
approaches to gender. He distinguished two conceptions of gender - gender as a
role in a society and gender as an indentity (i.e., the way in which one
experiences ones gender identity), and pointed out that the former
understanding was more prevalent in the past, while the latter seems to be
more prominent nowdays. With concrete examples, he illustrated some
argumentative fallacies present in feminist discourse. Namely, the &lt;em&gt;ad hominem&lt;/em&gt;
fallacy and the &lt;em&gt;inference from the conclusion&lt;/em&gt; forms of argumentation, in which
a suitable theory is sought after in order to justify some already accepted
positions. This suppposedly also shows that there are social pressures
influencing discussions about the biological foundations of gender. Then he
introduced results of scientific studies supporting his thesis about the
bilogical basis of gender. In the conclusion of his presentation, Doc. Dvořák
argued against the claims of feminist philosopher Judith Butler (&lt;em&gt;Bodies That
Matter&lt;/em&gt; (1993)), especially against her conception of gender as a result of
performative speech acts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presentations stimulated lively discussions, in part due to stark differences
between the positions of the speakers. Most of the questions were related to
biological foundations of gender roles, clarification of central concepts and
theoretical positions. In addition, some problems related to methodology of
scietific research were also touched upon, and several participants emphasized
the difference between correlation of two attributes and proof that they are
causaly related.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="activities"></category></entry><entry><title>Workshop III: On Human/Woman Nature, Naturalist and Constructivist Apporaches</title><link href="/en/third_workshop.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-11-26T16:32:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-11-26T16:32:00+01:00</updated><author><name>marvic</name></author><id>tag:None,2020-11-26:/en/third_workshop.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Our third workshop will take place in december (08.12).

Petra Chudárková. Our own team was represented by Mgr. Martin Nuhíček, PhD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first talk "Versions of naturalism in epistemology", Martin Nuhlíček has
characterized naturalistic positions in contemporary epistemology relative to
their traditional, non-naturalistic alternatives. He then distinguished radical
eleminative naturalism and its moderate, cooperative version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The focus of Filip Tvrdý's presentation "Naturalized epistemology of vices" was
virtue epistemology and its counterpart, the epistemology of vices. According to
Tvrdý, cognitive lazyness, that is, the inability or unwillingness to justify ones
beliefs, and metacognitive incompetence, which amounts to one being to unable or
unwilling to recognize ones errors, are two principal epistemic vices. Tvrdý
also claimed that these vices can be naturalized with the help of various
investigations in psychology and cognitive sciences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, in her presentation "Naturalism in moral epistemology", Petra Chudárková
first considered some ways in which intuitionism and coherentism
deals with the problem of moral justification and knowledge. She has found these
solutions lacking and proposed that naturalized approach in ethics, being 
constrained by empirical evidence and scientific method, is a plausible
alternative to solve given problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three speakers have pointed out some ways in which some aspects of
epistemology or ethics could be naturalized. However, the question of the
ability of naturalistic approaches to make traditional epistemology and ethics
eventually obsolete proved to be controversial, in the ensuing discussion.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="activities"></category></entry><entry><title>Workshop II: Naturalism Between Epistemology and Ethics</title><link href="/en/second_workshop.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-09-02T16:32:00+02:00</published><updated>2020-09-02T16:32:00+02:00</updated><author><name>marvic</name></author><id>tag:None,2020-09-02:/en/second_workshop.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;We are happy to announce that our second workshop will take place in september.

questions of naturalism conceived as an universal philosophcal programme has
taken the place on wednesday the 6th of november 2019. The topic of workshop was 
the issue of human nature as seen from the perspective of aristotelian and
neoaristotelian philosophy. Two guests have accepted our invitation to present
their ideas at the event: Doc. Mgr. Petr Dvořák, PhD. from the Czech Academy of
Sciences and Palacký University in Olomouc, and Doc. Mgr. Marian Kuna, MA,
MPhil, PhD. form the Catholic University in Ružomberok. Our own team was
represented by projects' principal investigator Prof. Mgr. Michal Chabada, PhD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petr Dvořák has spoken about the problem of natural kinds and essentialism. He has
focused on M. Nussbaums' conception of human nature as a collection of
dispositions and functions indispensable for human well-being, as well as on the
related theory of rational action authored by Ch. Koorsgaard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michal Chabada has dealt with the way in which the theory of human nature can be
based on the principles of aristotelian ethical naturalism, according to
philosopher Ph. Foot. In particular, Chabada has brought into focus the problem
of rational will as it relates to human needs and, more broadly, human life, and
to natural norms and their application to human virtues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marián Kuna introduced an aristotelian approach towards the question of human
nature in the writings of A. MacIntyre. He has traced MacIntyres movement
towards sociologically inspired aristotelianism and, subsequently, towards the
understanding of human nature motivated by Thomism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the ensuing discussion, workshop participants were primarily appreciative of the fact that 
Aristotles (or broadly aristotelian) philosophy is being systematically
reexamined. Several of them have pointed out that the fruitfulness of this
approach is sugggested by its compatiblity with contemporary biological or
evolutionary accounts of humans.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="activities"></category></entry><entry><title>Some Photos From Our First Workshop</title><link href="/en/first_workshop_photos.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-11-08T17:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-11-08T17:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>marvic</name></author><id>tag:None,2019-11-08:/en/first_workshop_photos.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Our first workshop took place on wednesday 6.11.2019.
